        I received a job offer mid-course and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

        "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i've been looking to make a transition and
        have heard some people who had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        extremely fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my 
        life. Since completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR
        Startup."

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from their experiences was easy.

        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”
